**THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS**

# Deep Learning Tutorial
This tutorial provides a brief introduction into the application of Artificial Neural Networks for classification tasks.  


## Setup
### The easy way
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TimRepke/DL_tutorial.git
cd DL_tutorial
chmod +x init/init.sh
./init/init.sh
source venv/bin/activate
jupyter notebook
```

When you are on linux, there is an init bash script at `init/init.sh` you can run. Set the `--no-venv` flag if you don't want to use a virtual environment. This script essentially (should) take care of the following two subsections for you.

### Install dependencies
We are not looking for high performance GPU accelerated computations here, so a basic installation of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is sufficient. It is assumed, that you have Python3 installed on your computer. We recommend using a virtual environment, but that's up to you.

```bash
# go to your workspace (or whereever)
cd ~/your/workspace

# (optional)
virtualenv -p python3 venv # if missing: 'sudo pip install virtualenv'

# install dependencies
pip install keras tensorflow jupyter numpy pandas sklearn matplotlib
```

### Before the tutorial
Since we might not have perfect internet connection during the hands on tutorial, please run 
```bash
cd ~/your/workspace

# (if using a virtual env)
source venv/bin/activate

# loading datasets and testing setup
python init/init.py

# more data
wget -O datasets/glove.6B.zip http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
cd datasets
unzip glove.6B.zip

# (leave the environment again)
deactivate
```

### During the tutorial
Download the `DLTutorial.ipynb` file (or clone the repository) and store it in `~/your/workspace`.
```bash
cd ~/your/workspace

# (if using a virtual env)
source venv/bin/activate # 'deactivate' to leave the environment again

# start notebook server
jupyter-notebook .
```
A browser tab should open. In the list you should see the file we just downloaded - open it! If you never used jupyter before, consult [their introduction](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html#notebook-user-interface).

### Presenting the tutorial
This section is for presenters only. Check out [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE), it seems nice and lets you switch into a presentation mode in your Jupyter Notebook as it is running.
```bash
pip install RISE
jupyter-nbextension install rise --py --sys-prefix
jupyter-nbextension enable rise --py --sys-prefix
```

In case you broke your notebook, go to `Edit->Edit Notebook Metadata` and add
```json
"livereveal": {
	"theme": "simple",
	"transition": "slide",
	"width": 1500,
	"height": 900,
	"scroll": false,
	"progress": true,
	"start_slideshow_at": "beginning"
}
```
Alternative options:
- `transition`: none, fade, slide, convex, concave, zoom, linear
- `theme`: black, white, league, sky, beige, simple, serif, blood, night, moon, solarized
- `start_slideshow_at`: beginning, selected

To configure which cells are part of the presentation, activate `View->Cell Toolbar->Slideshow`. Nothing selected is part of the previous slide, 'slide' begins a new slide or 'sub-slide', 'fragment's are for step by step reveals on a slide, 'skip' is not shown during presentation, whereas 'notes' are there as your speaker notes (not working).
